# Rails-guestbook

For a code challenge for a job, I was requested to put together a guestbook-style site in Rails. This is that! It's currently a work-in-progress, about an hour's work. As of right now, it just allows you to post things and delete them at-will - very, very simple.

To run it, ensure you have Ruby/Rails and all their prerequisites installed (more on that [on the Rails website](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html), you can check out the Rails installation guide here), download this repo, open up /blog in Powershell/command prompt/etc, and run `bin/rails server` (or `ruby bin/rails server` on Windows, I haven't been able to test on Mac OS/Linux).

More to come on how it works, what's good, what needs to be changed, etc.
